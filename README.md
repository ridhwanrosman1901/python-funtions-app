# Python Functions App

Welcome to the **Python Functions App**! This simple Python program showcases basic user interactions and manipulations of data through various functions. The app demonstrates different Python concepts, such as user input, arithmetic operations, list manipulation, and control flow.

## Features

1. **Greet the User**:
   - The program starts by asking the user for their name and then greets them with a personalized message.
   
2. **Calculate User's Future Age**:
   - The app prompts the user to enter their current age and calculates what their age will be in 5 years.
   
3. **Manipulate a List of Fruits**:
   - The program creates and manipulates a list of fruits by adding, removing, inserting, and sorting items.
   
4. **Loop with Break**:
   - The app asks the user to select a number they love (from 1 to 10) and then counts up to that number, stopping when the number is reached.
   
5. **Loop with Continue**:
   - The app then asks the user to select a number they hate (from 1 to 10) and skips that number while counting.
